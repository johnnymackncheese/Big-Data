# Introduction
This is our Big Data project for AP computer science class.
Our names are Leslie and Johnny and we created this page to convince Apple technology products to buy the mobile device application, Vine, and recreate it so users will buy their products and use the app.

# Here's Why
We used Google Trends and we found that the searches for "vine", "vines", "iconic vines", and "vines that keep me from ending it all", are highly searched and the app has been missed since it has been removed from the app store.
